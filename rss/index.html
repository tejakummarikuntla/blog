If we look from Today's Machine Learning pipeline at a high level this explicitly says that people spent most of the time on creating the Training Dataset and little hustle over Feature Engineering as Deep Learning makes it easy, the crucial part of creating a Training data set is labeling that data points correctly, because the performance of the end model totally depends on how well it trained with correct labels. Now, the question is can we hasten up the process of labeling using any Framework ?, This is where Snorkel began to accelerate Data Building and Managing, not only labeling, snorkel has many other features that make the bottlenecks unclogged.Snorkel: A framework for Rapidly Generating Training Data with Weak Supervision.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="tejakummarikuntla.github.io/blog/content/images/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-01-23-at-9.03.38-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="Snorkeling in Data for Supervision and Generation"><figcaption>Snorkel over Data Creation and Feature Engineering.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="weak-supervision"><strong>Weak Supervision</strong></h2><p>By eliminating the Hand labeling process, Now we can programmatically generate labels with external Domain knowledge or any patterns. This results in low-quality lables[Weak labels] more efficiently, which means Weak labels are intended to decrease the cost and increase efficiency. Using noisy, imprecise sources for building a large amount of training data in supervised learning is called Weak Supervision. One of the famous methodologies of weak labeling is Distant supervision. To reiterate Snorkel is an open-source system for quickly assembling training data through weak supervision.</p><h2 id="what-snorkel-can-do"><strong>What Snorkel can do?</strong></h2><p>Snorkel currently has three features for creating and handling training data sets.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Data Labeling:</strong></strong> Assigning a value to each data point based on Heruristc, Distant Supervision Techniques, etc.,</li><li><strong><strong>Data Transformation:</strong></strong> Converting existing data from one format to another or modifying the data which doesn't affect actual labels. e.g: rotating an image in different angles, etc.,</li><li><strong><strong>Data Slicing:</strong></strong> Segmenting a data set into required subsets for different purposes like improving model perfomance.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="tejakummarikuntla.github.io/blog/content/images/2020/04/fig_abstractions-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Snorkeling in Data for Supervision and Generation"><figcaption>Source: snorkel.org</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-snorkel-does-it"><strong>How Snorkel does it?</strong></h2><p>The Hight level Architecture of Snorkel's Workflow consist of Five Steps:</p><ol><li>Writing Labeling Functions.

Â Computer vision is the area of work where Data augmentation is used extensively, an Image can be augmented by rotating, flipping or adding filters, etc. When it befalls to the part of Text the complexity of applying Augmentation goes up. A simple example of transforming a text is by replacing the existing words in the document by its synonyms. Â But not every word can be replaceable such as a, an, the, etc.</p><p>When we ask what that really makes Data Transformation a big difference is the More the data we have, the better the model performs.

So, the Red and Blue colours are in reverse order and pyplot reflect this switch and results in a differently coloured image than original.</p><p>So, before we display the image letâs make a copy of the original image and use Open CV to change colour from BGR to RGB. Itâs good practice to always make a copy of the image youâre working with. This way any transformation youâll apply to the copy will not affect the original image, so itâs easier to undo a step or try something new.</p><p>Now, on this copied image <code>image_copy</code> we can perform a colour transformation using Open CV function <code>cvtColor()</code> , this takes a source image and colour conversion code, in this case, it is just BGR2RGB and then outputs the desired image.</p><hr><h3 id="defining-the-colour-threshold">Defining the Colour Threshold</h3><p>Now, we need to create a colour threshold to remove the desired blue region.</p><p>To create a Colour Threshold, we need to define lower and upper bounds for the colour that we need to isolate and remove -blue</p><p>weâll be using the colour threshold values to eventually select the blue screen area that contains this range of colour values and get rid of it.</p><pre><code>lower_blue = np.array([0, 0, 100])     ##[R value, G value, B value]
upper_blue = np.array([120, 100, 255])</code></pre><p>So, we defined the low threshold that contains the lowest values of red, green and blue that are still considered part of the blue screen background.</p><p>In <code>lower_blue</code> , for red and green, we set as 0, meaning itâs okay to have no red or green. But, the lowest value for blue should still be quite high, letâs say around 100.</p><p>Now, for <code>upper_blue</code>defined the upper threshold to allow little more red and green, and set the highest value for blue to <code>255</code>. Any colour within this low and high range will be an intense blue colour. this is just an estimation though. So, if we find that this range isnât finding the blue screen area we want, we can get back and change the values.</p><hr><h3 id="creating-a-mask">Creating a Mask</h3><p>We are gonna use the colour bound that are just created to create an image mask.</p><p>Masks are very common way to isolate a <code>selected area of intrest</code> and do something with that area.

plt.imshow(mask, cmap='gray')</code></pre><p>The <code>inRange()</code> function takes in an image in our lower and upper colour bounds and defines a mask by asking if the colour value of each image pixel falls in the range of the lower and upper colour thresholds. If it does fall in this range, the mask will be allowed to be displayed and if not it will block it out and turn the pixel black.</p><p>In fact, we can visualize the mask by plotting it as we would an image.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*mtSrH8zBZyTlSIPN7hGJYg.png" class="kg-image" alt="Blue or Green Screen Effect with OpenCV [Chroma keying]"><figcaption>plt.imshow(mask, cmap=âgrayâ)</figcaption></figure><p>The whole white area is where the image will be allowed to show through and the black will be blocked out.

And when we look at this mask we can see that it has a white area where the blue screen background is and the black area where the Christmas tree is.</p><p>Now, the first thing we need to do is let the Christmas tree show through and block the blue screen background.</p><hr><pre><code>masked_image = np.copy(image_copy)
masked_image[mask != 0] = [0, 0, 0]

By focusing the light thatâs reflected off of objects in the world. In this case, though a small pinhole, the camera focuses the light thatâs reflected off to a 3D traffic sign and forms a 2D image at the back of the camera.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*R7Ec-32NFWWf9E7K9SgnRA.png" class="kg-image" alt="Camera Calibration withÂ OpenCV"></figure><p>In math, the Transformation from 3D object points, P of X, Y and Z to X and Y is done by a transformative matrix called the<strong> camera matrix(C)</strong>, weâll be using this to calibrate the camera.</p><p>However, real cameras donât use tiny pinholes; they use <strong>lenses</strong> to focus on multiple light rays at a time which allows them to quickly form images. But, lenses can introduce <strong>distortion</strong> too.</p><blockquote>Light lays often bend a little too much at the edges of a curved lens of a camera, and this creates the effect that distorts the edges of the images.</blockquote><h3 id="types-of-distortion">Types of Distortion</h3><p><strong><em>Radial Distortion:</em> </strong>Radial Distortion is the most common type that affects the images, In which when a camera captured pictures of straight lines appeared slightly curved or bent</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*fUl8POYptRmR4UzCM4Ox8Q.png" class="kg-image" alt="Camera Calibration withÂ OpenCV"><figcaption>Radially Distorted by a&nbsp;camera</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>Tangential distortion: </em></strong>Tangential distortion occurs mainly because the lens is not parallely aligned to the imaging plane, that makes the image to be extended a little while longer or tilted, it makes the objects appear farther away or even closer than they actually are.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/1*VaeeJWD3M3Qu2BbJ-hyuNg.png" class="kg-image" alt="Camera Calibration withÂ OpenCV"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*bkF_vos8mQSFe7jy5JXsJA.png" class="kg-image" alt="Camera Calibration withÂ OpenCV"></figure><p>So, In order to reduce the distortion, luckily this distortion can be captured by five numbers called <strong>Distortion Coefficients</strong>, whose values reflect the amount of radial and tangential distortion in an image.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*kDPV6S_yLNE15lwuC9nxQA.png" class="kg-image" alt="Camera Calibration withÂ OpenCV"></figure><p>If we know the values of all the coefficients, we can use them to calibrate our camera and undistort the distorted images.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*2dc3TTGhlqfQNp_XJY3xKw.png" class="kg-image" alt="Camera Calibration withÂ OpenCV"><figcaption>Undistorting the Distorted Image with Distortion Coefficients.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="measuring-distortion"><strong>Measuring Distortion</strong></h3><p>So, we know that the distortion changes the size and shape of the object in an image.

Itâs recommended to use at least 20 images to get a reliable calibration, For this, we have a lot of images here, each chess board has eight by six corners to detect,</p><p>To calibrate a camera, OpenCV gives us the <strong><em>calibrateCamera()</em></strong> function</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*-CDYzCBsuSB0uFN9GTd6yw.png" class="kg-image" alt="Camera Calibration withÂ OpenCV"></figure><p>This takes in Object points, Image points[<em>will understand these points in a moment</em>], and the shape of the image and using these inputs, it calculates and returns</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*VVKMMo_RnI0bUw_6h4CXMA.png" class="kg-image" alt="Camera Calibration withÂ OpenCV"></figure><p><strong>mtx</strong>: Camera Matrix, which helps to transform 3D objects points to 2D image points.</p><p><strong>dist:</strong> distortion coefficient</p><p>It also returns the position of the camera in the world, with the values of rotation and translation vectors <strong>rvecs, tvecs</strong></p><p>The next function that we require is <strong><em>undistort()</em></strong>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*4wjojfc9y4edjrBW_Va0Lw.png" class="kg-image" alt="Camera Calibration withÂ OpenCV"></figure><p>The undistort function takes in a distorted image, our camera matrix, and distortion coefficients and it returns an <strong>undistorted</strong>, often called <strong>destination image.</strong></p><p>In calibrateCamera() function we need object points and image points.</p><pre><code>import numpy as np 
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
#read in a calibration image
img = mpimg.imread('../calibration_images/calibration1.jpg')
plt.imshow(img)</code></pre><p>First, Done with numpy, openCV, and plotting imports, then we are gonna read the first image <code>calibarion1.jpg</code> and display it.</p><p>Now, we are gonna map the coordinates of the corners in the 2D displayed image which called as <code>imagepoints</code> , to the 3D coordinates of the real, undistorted chessboard corners, which are called as <code>objectpoinst</code>.</p><p>So, we are gonna set up two empty arrays to hold these points, <code>objectpoints</code> and <code>imagepoints</code></p><pre><code># Arrays to store object points and image points from all the images
objpoints = [] # 3D points in real world space
imgpoints = [] # 2D points in image plane</code></pre><p>The object points will all be the same, just the known object corners of the chess board corners for an eight by six board.</p><p>So, we are going to prepare these object points, first by creating six by eight points in an array, each with three columns for the x,y and z coordinates of each corner. We will then initialize all these to 0s using Numpyâs zeros function. The z coordinates will stay zero so leave that as it is but, for our first two columns x and y, use Numpyâs <code>mgrid</code> function to generate the coordinates that we want. <code>mgrid</code> returns the coordinate values for given grid size and shape those coordinates back into two columns, one for x and one for y:</p><pre><code># Prepare obj points, like (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (2, 0, 0)....., (7, 5, 0)
objp = np.zeros((6*8,3), np.float32)
objp[:,:,] =  mp.mgrid[0:8,0:6].T.reshape(-1,2) # x,y coordinates</code></pre><p>Next to create the <code>imagepoints</code>, we need to consider the distorted calibrated image and detect the corners of the board. OpenCV gives us an easy way to detect chessboard corners with a function called <code>findChessboardCorners()</code>, that returns the corners found in a grayscale image.</p><p>So, we will convert the image to greyscale and then pass that to the <code>findChessboardCorners()</code> function. This function takes in a <code>grayscle</code> image along with the dimensions of the chess board corners. In this case 8 by 6 and last parameter is for any flags; there are none in this example:</p><pre><code># Convert image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BRG2GRAY)
# Find the Chesse board corners
rer, corners = cv2.findChessboardCorners(gray, (8,6), None)</code></pre><p>If this function detects corners, we are gonna append those points to the image points array and also add our prepared object points <code>objp</code> to the <code>objectpoints</code> array. These object points will be the same for all of the calibration images since they represent a real chessboard.</p><pre><code># If corners are found, add object points, image points
if ret == True:
    imgpoints.append(corners)
    objpoints.append(objp)</code></pre><p>Next, we also draw the detected corners, with a call to <code>drawChessboardCorners()</code> , that takes in our image, corner dimensions and corner points.</p><pre><code># If corners are found, add object points, image points
if ret == True:
    imgpoints.append(corners)
    objpoints.append(objp)
    
    # Draw and display the corners
    img = cv2.drawChessboardCorners(img, (8,6), corners, ret)
