If we look from Today's Machine Learning pipeline at a high level this explicitly says that people spent most of the time on creating the Training Dataset and little hustle over Feature Engineering as Deep Learning makes it easy, the crucial part of creating a Training data set is labeling that data points correctly, because the performance of the end model totally depends on how well it trained with correct labels. Now, the question is can we hasten up the process of labeling using any Framework ?, This is where Snorkel began to accelerate Data Building and Managing, not only labeling, snorkel has many other features that make the bottlenecks unclogged.Snorkel: A framework for Rapidly Generating Training Data with Weak Supervision.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="tejakummarikuntla.github.io/blog/content/images/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-01-23-at-9.03.38-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="Snorkeling in Data for Supervision and Generation"><figcaption>Snorkel over Data Creation and Feature Engineering.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="weak-supervision"><strong>Weak Supervision</strong></h2><p>By eliminating the Hand labeling process, Now we can programmatically generate labels with external Domain knowledge or any patterns. This results in low-quality lables[Weak labels] more efficiently, which means Weak labels are intended to decrease the cost and increase efficiency. Using noisy, imprecise sources for building a large amount of training data in supervised learning is called Weak Supervision. One of the famous methodologies of weak labeling is Distant supervision. To reiterate Snorkel is an open-source system for quickly assembling training data through weak supervision.</p><h2 id="what-snorkel-can-do"><strong>What Snorkel can do?</strong></h2><p>Snorkel currently has three features for creating and handling training data sets.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Data Labeling:</strong></strong> Assigning a value to each data point based on Heruristc, Distant Supervision Techniques, etc.,</li><li><strong><strong>Data Transformation:</strong></strong> Converting existing data from one format to another or modifying the data which doesn't affect actual labels. e.g: rotating an image in different angles, etc.,</li><li><strong><strong>Data Slicing:</strong></strong> Segmenting a data set into required subsets for different purposes like improving model perfomance.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="tejakummarikuntla.github.io/blog/content/images/2020/04/fig_abstractions-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Snorkeling in Data for Supervision and Generation"><figcaption>Source: snorkel.org</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-snorkel-does-it"><strong>How Snorkel does it?</strong></h2><p>The Hight level Architecture of Snorkel's Workflow consist of Five Steps:</p><ol><li>Writing Labeling Functions.

Log-scale informs on relative changes (multiplicative), while linear-scale informs on absolute changes (additive). When do you use each? When you care about relative changes, use the log-scale; when you care about absolute changes, use linear-scale. This is true for distributions, but also for any quantity or changes in quantities.</p>
<p>Note, I use the word &quot;care&quot; here very specifically and intentionally. Without a model or a goal, your question cannot be answered; the model or goal defines which scale is important. If you're trying to model something, and the mechanism acts via a relative change, log-scale is critical to capturing the behavior seen in your data. But if the underlying model's mechanism is additive, you'll want to use linear-scale.</p>

<p>The log function maps the small range of numbers between (0, 1) to the entire range of negative numbers (–∞, 0). The function log10(x) maps the range of [1, 10] to [0, 1], [10, 100] to [1, 2], and so on. In other words, the log function compresses the range of large numbers and expands the range of small numbers. The larger x is, the slower log(x) increments.</p>
